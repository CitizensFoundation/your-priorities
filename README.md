Your Priorities is a web based platform that enables groups of people to define their democratic ideas and together discover which are the most important ideas to implement by their instances.  People can add new ideas, add arguments for and against ideas, indicate if they support or oppose an idea, create a personal list of ideas and discuss all ideas. The end results are lists of top ideas in many categories as well as the best arguments for and against each idea. This service enables people to make up their minds about most issues in a short time.

Your Priorities is being used on the https://www.yrpri.org/ eDemocracy service and the Better Reykjavik website in Iceland amongst other places.

Docker on Ubuntu
================

Install docker
````bash
Visit http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/
````

Install git
````bash
sudo apt-get install git
````

Clone Your Priorities locally
````bash
cd /yourpath
git clone https://github.com/rbjarnason/your-priorities.git
````
Copy database config template (no change needed):
````bash
cd your-priorities
cp config/database.yml.dist config/database.yml
````

Option 1 - Install Your Priorities images from Docker Index
````bash
sudo docker pull yrpri/base
sudo docker pull yrpri/postgresql
sudo docker pull yrpri/rails
(optional IRC support)
sudo docker pull yrpri/ngircd
sudo docker pull yrpri/kiwiirc
````

Option 2 - Build docker repositories from github dockerfiles
````bash
# Base docker repository
git clone https://github.com/rbjarnason/docker-base.git
cd docker-base
sudo docker build -t yrpri/base .
cd ..

And the same for:
https://github.com/rbjarnason/docker-postgresql.git and yrpri/postgresql
https://github.com/rbjarnason/docker-rails.git and yrpri/rails
(optional IRC support)
https://github.com/rbjarnason/docker-ngircd.git and yrpri/ngircd
https://github.com/rbjarnason/docker-kiwiirc.git and yrpri/kiwiirc
````

Start database
````bash
sudo docker run -i -t -d --name postgresql yrpri/postgresql
````

Optional IRC support
````bash
sudo docker -D run -d -p 6667:6667 yrpri/ngircd
sudo docker -D run -d -p 7778:7778 -v /root/certs:/etc/kiwiirc -e KIWI_IRC_SERVER_HOST=irc.yrpri.org -e KIWI_IRC_SERVER_PORT=6667 yrpri/kiwiirc
````

Start rails docker image pointing to your local Your Priorities installation
````bash
sudo docker -D run -d -link postgresql:db -p 3000:3000 -v /yourpath/your-priorities:/var/www/your-priorities -e APP_NAME=your-priorities yrpri/rails
````

See if it is running
````bash
sudo docker ps
````
Test it
````bash
The image will take a little while to start up, it will have to run bundle install each time its started.
Browser to http://localhost:3000/ or http://your.ip.addr.number:3000
````

Debug the docker image
````bash
sudo docker ps -notrunc
sudo lxc-attach --name long_uid_from_docker_ps
<now you are in the image>
cd /var/log/supervisor
tail -f *
````

Default admin user and password
````bash
admin@admin.is
admin
````

Setup the project locally
=========================

Fork the project from github.com
````bash
1. Create a github account if you do not have one
2. Make sure you are logged in
3. Click the "Fork" button at the top of the page to create your own fork
````

Download / clone on your local Ubuntu installation
````bash
(replace YOURNAME with your github username)
git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/your-priorities.git
````

Setup git to easily merge from the main branch
Add the following to the .git/config file
````bash
[remote "robert"]
        url = git@github.com:rbjarnason/your-priorities.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/robert/*
````

Merge the latest changes from the master branch
````bash
git fetch robert
git merge robert/master
````

Development on Linux
====================

Install rvm the Ruby version manager
````bash
sudo apt-get install curl
\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
````

Find out what dependencies are needed for Ruby (MRI) and install them:

````bash
$ rvm requirements
````

Install and use Ruby 2.0.0
````bash
$ rvm install 2.0.0
$ rvm use 2.0.0
```` 

Go into the application dir and install all gems. On Ubuntu:
````bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
sudo apt-get install mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev
bundle install
````

Install database dependencies
````bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
````

Then start the psql shell
````bash
sudo su postgres
psql
````

When in psql create a user and the Your Priorities dev database
````bash
CREATE USER puser PASSWORD 'xxxxxxxx'
CREATE DATABASE yrpri_dev WITH ENCODING 'utf8';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE yrpri_dev TO puser;
ALTER USER puser CREATEDB;
````

Then exit the postgres shell and copy and edit the config/database.yml.dist file
````bash
cd config
cp database.yml.dist database.yml
````

Then edit the database.yml file for your puser password

When ready create the database tables and seed the database:
````bash
rake db:schema:load
rake db:seed

This will create an admin user with the email admin@admin.is and password admin
````

Start the server
````bash
rails s
````

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/

Running the test
================

Currently Your Priorities only has one working test, more tests would be appricated. 
This one test is based on Selenium and tests most of the user facing features. To 
run the tests you need to open up two terminal windows.  You need to have Firefox 
installed.


In the first window you start the integration test before running the command in the other window
````bash
rake test:integration
````

In the second window when you see the test database being created from the output start the test server.
If you start it too early then the database cant be dropped for recreation and if you start the server too 
then Selenium won't have a server to test against.
````bash
rails s -e test
````

Installing Sphinx search
========================

Please see: 
http://pat.github.io/thinking-sphinx/


Cron tasks that are needed
==========================

Idea ranking calculations
````bash
rake schedule:idea_ranker
````

For updating the search index
````bash
rake fs:index
````
